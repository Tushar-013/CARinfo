Lamborghini Aventador Svj</h1>
<p>The Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce Jota or 'SVJ' made its global debut earlier this year and now, India's first example of the limited edition supercar has landed in the country. India's first Lamborghini Aventador SVJ has been delivered in Bangalore, Karnataka to a private buyer and this is the third model to be delivered globally. The first Aventador SVJ in India is finished in rich metallic blue shade and looks absolutely stunning with its menacing appeal. Prices for the limited edition is still under wraps, but we'll get to know that soon with Lamborghini India scheduled to officially launch the car later this month. Revealed at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance earlier this year, only 600 examples of the SVJ will ever produced. The Aventador is in its final years of production and the SVJ only takes the manufacturer to a completely different of desirability.

The Lamborghini Aventador SVJ takes the design quotient to manic levels on the supercar over the S and even the SV versions. The car comes with additional vents on the bonnet, a larger front splitter and a new rear wing that is held in place by two curved arms and a centre arm. The car also comes with a new dual-pipe exhaust system. The new system enhances the diffuser's effectiveness by removing exhaust gases from an aerodynamically sensitive area.

<h1>Bugatti La Voture Noir</h1>
<p>At the 2019 Geneva motor show, Bugatti has revealed the most expensive new car of all time – the ‘La Voiture Noire’, which is a one-off homage to Jean Bugatti’s iconic Type 57 SC Atlantic.<br>

Bugatti had released a number of teasers of the hypercar over the past few weeks in a series of videos highlighting the history and heritage of the original production Atlantics, only four of which were ever built. The build-up led to the official unveiling of the new car at this year’s Geneva motor show.<br>

The La Voiture Noire sports an aggressive styling at the front with a more pronounced grille than either the Veyron or the Chiron, while the headlights recede back above the wheel arches rather than being placed horizontally above the bumper, which now protrudes sharply.<br>

While the styling isn’t entirely reminiscent of the smooth coupe contours and elongated bonnet of the original Atlantic, the most definitive stylistic aspect has been retained; the dorsal seam running up along bonnet, between the windows and over the roof of the body (although the rivets have been left out).

At the rear, a continuous rear light runs along a grille-like back end, McLaren P1-style, with the Bugatti name illuminated in white below. All this sits above a bespoke exhaust set-up comprising six separate pipes running away from the car's 1500hp, 8.0-litre 16-cylinder engine. From the specs, it is likely to be the same engine used in the Chiron.

The Voiture Noire is priced at €11 million (approximately Rs 88 crore), making it the most expensive new car ever. However, the Voitre Noire has already been sold; Bugatti did not name the buyer, only saying that they are a ‘Bugatti enthusiast’.<br>
<h1>Sportscar</h1>
<p>A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.[2][3] The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.[4] According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928.[2] Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.[5]<br>

Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are requisite.[6] Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a lower center of gravity than standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.[7] Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coupés also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.[8][9]<br>
Attributing the definition of 'sports car' to any particular model can be controversial or the subject of debate among enthusiasts.[10][11][12] Authors and experts have often contributed their own ideas to capture a definition.[13][14][15][16]

A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car. Performance modifications of regular, production cars, such as sport compacts, sports sedans, muscle cars, pony cars and hot hatches, generally are not considered sports cars, yet share traits common to sports cars. Certain models can "appeal to both muscle car and sports car enthusiasts, two camps that rarely acknowledged each other's existences."[17][18][19] Some models are called "sports cars" for marketing purposes to take advantage of greater marketplace acceptance and for promotional purposes.[20] High-performance cars of various configurations are grouped as Sports and Grand tourer cars[21] or, occasionally, just as performance cars.<br>
